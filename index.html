<h1><b>Mobile Legends</b></h1> 
<p align="justify"><b>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</b> is a mobile <b>multiplayer online battle arena</B> game developed and published by Chinese developer Moonton, a subsidiary of ByteDance. The game was released in 2016 and grew in popularity, most prominently in Southeast Asia. </p> 
<p align="justify">At its base gameplay, the game puts 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 20-60 second matchmaking and 10-30 minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own while securing objectives in order to pressure the opposing team. Like classic MOBAS, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angle-winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.</p> 
<h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2> 
p align="justify">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a <b>multiplayer online battle arena</b> (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. 
< The game is free-to-play and is only monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins. Each player can control a selectable character, called a Hero, with unique abilities and traits. There are six roles that define the main purpose of heroes: Tank, Marksman, Assassin, Fighter, Mage, and Support. These roles determine the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Players can also set specific builds for heroes which include in-game items and emblems.</p> 
<h2><b>Ranked and classic</b></h2> 
<p align="justify">Two teams of five players go against each other in real-time. Players will be matched in correspondence with their current ranking. There are seven ranks in the game with Warrior being the lowest followed by Elite, Master, Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and the highest rank, Mythic. [13] A player can only invite and form a team with other players of similar rank or players that are one rank higher or lower.</p>

<h2><b>Arcade and other modes</b></h2> 
<p align="justify">Arcade is an additional game mode in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang that can time-to-time be playable during special events, holidays, or occasions. The mode feature various strategy based sub-games.</p> 
<p align="justify">Brawl is a game mode where players are given two random heroes in their inventory at the start of the game. This mode contains only one lane with two turrets defending the base of both teams. Items can only be bought inside the base and players that leave it cannot re-enter unless when respawning. A special variation called Shadow Brawl is Sreleased from time to time. The difference is players at the start of the game will choose from the same set of heroes. The hero with the most votes will be used by the entire team.</p> 
<h2><b>Development</b></h2> 
<p align="justify">After Moonton's staff of 20 finished developing its first game called Magic Rush: <b>Heroes, released in 2015 to commercial success, they proceeded with developing the company's next project, a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game later titled Mobile Legends.</b> The staff's experience with engineering Magic Rush: Heroes for a global market, such as customizing its features for the differing cultures and state of telecommunications of various countries, became beneficial for them to effectively design Mobile Legends as an appealing game for global players. Mobile Legends was released by Moonton with the subtitle "5v5 MOBA" on 14 July 2016. The game was distributed by Elex Tech in the United States. However, after the lawsuit from Riot Games in 2017, Moonton has removed the game from Google Play and re-released it as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.</p>
